# Source Notes

## Purpose

This starter converts the customer-support case-study guidance into a small
local-path workflow for email triage and policy-grounded reply drafting.

## Official Inputs

- [OpenAI computer environment for agents](https://openai.com/index/equip-responses-api-computer-environment/)
- [OpenAI Responses API tools and file search](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-and-features-in-the-responses-api/)
- [Claude Code MCP documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp)
- [MCP roots](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/client/roots)
- [MCP resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/resources)

## Repo-Native Changes

- Reduced the workflow to local email text plus local policy text.
- Kept the first version draft-only rather than auto-send.
- Used a skill file to show how a reusable local-agent workflow can be packaged.
- Clarified the starter's review boundary: local input, local policy, draft
  artifact, and human send decision.

## Attribution Boundary

This folder does not copy upstream code or documentation. It uses official
sources as conceptual grounding for local tool boundaries, file context, and
workflow packaging.

## Open Questions

- Should a v2 include a real Gmail or helpdesk adapter?
- Should policies become structured YAML/JSON sections instead of plain text?
- Which escalation cases should be represented as evaluation fixtures first?
