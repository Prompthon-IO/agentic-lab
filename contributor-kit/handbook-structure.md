# Handbook Structure

This document holds the internal structure and reference notes that support the
handbook. It is intentionally separate from the top-level README so the front
door can stay lightweight.

## Current status

- The top-level handbook lanes are now scaffolded in the repository.
- Imported reference material remains available under `references/`.
- Audience guides and contributor templates are in place for future content
  work.
- Most topic pages are still to be authored.

## What this handbook covers

- Agent system fundamentals and terminology
- Reusable agent patterns and workflow mechanisms
- Systems concerns such as context, protocols, evaluation, and reliability
- Ecosystem comparisons across global and Chinese agent tooling
- Story-led case studies for major agent product categories
- Fast-moving radar and publication extensions

## Repository structure

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `foundations/` | Core concepts, terminology, and mental models |
| `patterns/` | Reusable agent design patterns and mechanisms |
| `systems/` | Production-minded systems topics such as evaluation and interoperability |
| `ecosystem/` | Topic-first comparisons of tools, models, and platforms |
| `case-studies/` | Story-led examples for major agent archetypes |
| `radar/` | Fast-moving market and protocol tracking |
| `reading-paths/` | Audience-first entry points into the handbook |
| `publications/` | Metadata and structure for external reading extensions |
| `contributor-kit/` | Templates and editorial scaffolding for contributions |
| `references/` | Imported source material and planning documents |

## Editorial direction

- Path-first, not chapter-first
- Story-led pages that move from problem to architecture to tradeoffs
- Topic-first ecosystem coverage with explicit global and Chinese lanes
- Repo-native content outside `references/`, with source-aware adaptation

## Reference base and reuse boundary

The current reference base includes the upstream `Hello-Agents` materials under
[`references/hello-agents-main/`](../references/hello-agents-main/).

That material is being used here as source input for curation and planning, not
as the final published structure of this repository. The strategy document that
guided this first-pass scaffold lives at
[`references/global-agent-repository-strategy.md`](../references/global-agent-repository-strategy.md).

If content is later adapted from upstream material, attribution and license
constraints should be reviewed before publication.
