# Local Agent Tooling Source Map

## Summary

This note gathers official source inputs for contributors writing about local
agent systems: agents that work near a user's files, tools, project state, and
workflow instructions rather than operating only as a remote chat surface.

The durable pattern is not "local" by itself. It is the combination of:

- an execution environment or local tool boundary
- reusable skill or workflow packaging
- explicit filesystem or document scope
- resources that can be selected, searched, read, or refreshed
- permission rules that make the boundary understandable to users

## Why It Matters

Local-agent topics are becoming easy to overstate. A useful handbook treatment
should separate several concerns that are often mixed together:

- `runtime`: where commands, scripts, files, or containers run
- `skills`: how reusable task knowledge is packaged
- `roots`: which local filesystem areas a tool-facing server may see
- `resources`: which files, schemas, records, or application objects can be
  exposed as model context
- `connectors`: how local and remote services become callable tools

That split helps contributors write case studies and starter projects without
pretending that every integration is the same kind of agent capability.

## Scope Notes

Included:

- official OpenAI source material on Responses API tools, file search, remote
  MCP support, and computer environments
- official MCP material on roots and resources
- official Claude Code material on local stdio servers, project/user scopes,
  and MCP resources

Excluded:

- third-party MCP server listings
- unofficial prompt-injection commentary
- vendor comparisons that do not change the handbook's local-agent mental
  model
- implementation details for a production email or CRM integration

## Source Map

- [OpenAI Responses API tools and remote MCP support](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-and-features-in-the-responses-api/):
  a current source for remote MCP support, built-in tools, file search, and
  background-mode style long-running agent work.
- [OpenAI computer environment for agents](https://openai.com/index/equip-responses-api-computer-environment/):
  a current source for the execution-environment side of agent design,
  including shell access, hosted filesystem state, compaction, and agent
  skills.
- [MCP introduction](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro):
  a stable entry point for MCP as a standard connection layer between AI
  applications and external systems such as local files, databases, tools, and
  workflows.
- [MCP roots](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/client/roots):
  the clearest official source for local filesystem boundaries. Roots define
  which directories or files a server can understand as available.
- [MCP resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/resources):
  the clearest official source for application-driven context surfaces such as
  files, schemas, or application-specific objects.
- [Claude Code MCP documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp):
  a practical source for local stdio servers, project-scoped MCP
  configuration, plugin-provided MCP servers, and MCP resources in a coding
  agent workflow.

## Synthesis

The strongest local-agent spine is a layered one:

1. The user or host application chooses an operating boundary.
2. Tools and servers expose capabilities inside that boundary.
3. Resources and roots describe which context can be read or selected.
4. Skills package repeatable task knowledge.
5. The agent produces an artifact or action that can be reviewed.

For handbook purposes, this is more useful than saying "the agent has access to
files." Local access should always be explained with the boundary attached:
which files, which server, which transport, which permission, and which
artifact.

## Case-Study Hooks

Good local-agent case studies should make the boundary visible:

- customer-support email agent: inbound message path plus local policy
  document path
- coding agent: repository root plus issue, test, and branch permissions
- operations agent: dashboard or database resource plus read-only query rules
- research agent: source folder plus citation artifact output

Each case should state what the agent may read, what it may write, and what
requires human review.

## Gaps And Follow-up

- Add a production-readiness note on local-agent security risks, especially
  prompt injection from untrusted files and connectors.
- Add a small matrix comparing direct local scripts, local stdio MCP servers,
  remote MCP servers, and platform-hosted tools.
- Expand the customer-support case study once the starter code includes a real
  mailbox or Gmail adapter.

## Update Log

- 2026-04-23: Added a contributor-facing source map for local agent tooling,
  skills, roots, resources, and file-grounded workflows.
